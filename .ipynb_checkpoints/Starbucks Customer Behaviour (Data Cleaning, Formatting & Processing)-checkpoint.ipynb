We can also consider that they have been influenced on any purchases between viewing and completing the offer as it may be an accumulation offer (e.g. spend more than 10 dollars between a certain period).\n",

Any purchase in that period that also completed the offer will be treated as being influenced.\n",

    "Now that I have how much users normally spend we can try to determine if transactions made throughout the offer period were influenced by the offer or not for each user. There are a number of ways this can be done but again it's probably best to use a unique approch per offer:\n",

    "- For the BOGO offers that invole buying multiple items it would be most simple just to see the average transaction order for the user and then compair that to completed orders. If the completed orders plus the discount are significatly higher (close to two times what they would normally pay) we know the that they've been very likely influenced by the offer.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The discount offers are slightly more difficult as they cover multiple transactions leading up to a completed offer. In this case we can look at how much a user normally spends over the given offer period and see if the dicount period is significantly higher. This is difficult on our current dataset as we don't have much history on spend data prior to this period. To get around this problem we could split the users into certain demographics and look at their behaviour as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, informational offers are the most tricky to deal with and could be treated in a numeber of ways. We could for instance build a model for each specific users spending habits but this would be very time consuming and the data we have per user is limited so is out of the scope of this project. Again we can judge them based on their demographic and build a model of normal spending patterns off that. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the discount and informational offers it's more difficult to see if a user was influenced into spending more than their normal amount on a user by user level. Instead I will look at different demographics of users with the consumer profile above and judge if a user has been influenced based on that. In the next notebook I will assess how we should be splitting our user data into certain demographics."
