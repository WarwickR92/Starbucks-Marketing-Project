# Starbucks Marketing Project

This project has been created in an attempt to determine which of the Starbucks demographic groups respond best to which types of offers. The bussiness case for this is simple, it will enable Starbucks to target different dempgraphics with unique and impactful offers. It will also mean that Starbucks is not loosing money on consumers that would have brought items regardless of the offer. This should ultimatly increase both increase sales and profits.

As such the aim of this project will be to predict the amount a user will spend normally in each demographic and also predict how this will increase depending on the type of offer used. This should allow Starbucks to model future offers served to consumers to see which one's should be more effective prior to implementation. 

### Data Sources:
The following data sources have been provided by Starbucks to undertake this analysis:
- portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- profile.json - demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

The layout of this project will follow the priciples of the CRISP-DM framework starting with the buissness understanding as outlined above and then moving through data understanding, data prepartaion, modelling and finally evaluation.
